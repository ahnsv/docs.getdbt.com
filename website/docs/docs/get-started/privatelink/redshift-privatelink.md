The first step is to grant access to dbt Cloud in the Redshift database cluster:

1. On the running Redshift cluster, select the **Properties** tab.

2. In the **Granted accounts** section, click **Grant access**.

3. Enter the AWS account ID:

- Use `346425330055` for multi-tenant deployment environments in dbt Cloud
- Use `952445382732` for single-tenant deployment environments in dbt Cloud

Optionally, provide the VPC ID for the single-tenant instance or regional multi-tenant PrivateLink VPC. Otherwise, choose **Grant access to all VPCs**.

4. Then, contact the dbt Cloud support team and provide them with your:

- Cluster name
- AWS account ID (where the Redshift cluster is hosted)
- Cluster AWS region

## Configuring Interface VPC PrivateLink


Creating an Interface VPC PrivateLink connection requires creating multiple AWS resources in the account containing the Redshift cluster:

- **Security Group** &mdash; If you are connecting to an existing Redshift cluster, this likely already exists, however, you might need to add or modify Security Group rules to accept traffic from the Network Load Balancer (NLB) created for this Endpoint Service.
- **Target Group** &mdash; The Target Group gets attached to the NLB to tell it where to route requests. There are various target types available for NLB Target Groups, but you will use the IP address.
    
Use IP addresses from the Redshift cluster’s **Network Interfaces**, _not_ IPs listed in the **Node IP addresses** section as those can change.

There is likely only one Network Interface (NI) to start, but if the cluster fails over to another availability zone (AZ), a new NI will be created for that AZ as well. The NI IP from the original AZ should still work, but the new NI IP can also be added to the Target Group if desired. Just note that the NLB will need to add that AZ as well. Once created, an NI shouldn't change (this is our observation from testing, but is not officially documented anywhere).

The cluser must be configured to use TCP protocol.

- Network Load Balancer (NLB) &mdash; Requires creating a Listener that attaches to the newly created Target Group for port `5439`
- Endpoint Service &mdash; Attach to the newly created NLB.
    - Acceptance required (optional) &mdash; Requires you to [accept our connection request](https://www.notion.so/Redshift-Interface-PrivateLink-Setup-Guide-dabac5da3f7c4b0b91716b37820f5aeb) after dbt creates the endpoint.
    - Private DNS name (optional) &mdash; This hasn't been tested and might not be supported. Please contact dbt Cloud support if you require this field. 

### Grant AWS account access to the VPC

On the provisioned VPC endpoint service, click the **Allow principals** tab. Click **Allow principals** to grant access. Enter the ARN of the root user in the appropriate production AWS account and save your changes.

| Type | Principal |
| --- | --- |
| Single-Tenant Prod | arn:aws:iam::952445382732:root |
| Multi-Tenant Prod | arn:aws:iam::346425330055:root |

<Lightbox src="/img/docs/dbt-cloud/redshiftprivatelink5.png" title="Enter ARN"/>

Once the VPC Endpoint Service is provisioned, you can find the service name in the AWS console by navigating to **VPC** → **Endpoint Services** and selecting the appropriate endpoint service. You can copy the service name field value and include it in your communication to dbt Cloud support.

## Configuring new endpoints with PrivateLink

Once dbt Cloud support completes the configuration, you can start creating new connections using PrivateLink.

1. Navigate to **settings** → **Create new project** → select **Redshift**
2. Select **Private** for a private connection.
3. Select the private endpoint from the dropdown. When you do this, dbt Cloud automatically populates the hostname/account field.
4. Configure the remaining data platform details.
5. Test your connection and save it.
